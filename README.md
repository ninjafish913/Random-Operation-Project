# Random-Operation-Project
Write a program that can perform three different activities:

 - Generate one random integer from 2 to 10, and then display all of the numbers from 100 to 200 that are evenly divisible by the random integer.
 - Generate one random positive integer from 2 to 200, and then display all of the prime numbers from 2 to the random integer.
 - Generate one random positive integer from 1 to 100, and then display all of the numbers in octal notation from 1 to the random integer.

When the program is run, a number from 1 to 3 should be randomly generated to determine which of the three tasks should be performed.
